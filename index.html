    <hr/>
    <p>I have been a Software Developer since 2020, <br/>
        holding a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. <br/>
        My expertise spans both front-end and back-end web development. <br/>
        Alongside my technical career, I have nurtured a lifelong passion for the arts, <br/>
        which has led me to transition into the digital world as a Graphic Designer and Digital Artist.
